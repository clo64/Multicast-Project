Command line arguments accessed inside sys.argv, can iterate as array
print(f"Arguments count: {len(sys.argv)}")
    for i, arg in enumerate(sys.argv):
        print(f"Argument {i:>6}: {arg}")

Host accepts two command line arguments for now
-id is the router's own id, and -rid is the id of the router its attached to
    pypthon3 host.py -id 100 -rid 200
